Throughout my life, I’ve experienced cycles of anxiety that would ebb and flow, often unexpectedly. In my junior year of high school, I was formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder—a recognition that finally gave a name to the overwhelming hurdles I encountered in my daily life. Simple, everyday tasks became complex and burdensome, as if each required scaling a mountain with no summit in sight.

I stumbled into running as a means of release, not from an athletic ambition but from a need to quiet my mind. Long night runs allowed me to exhaust the mental clutter that weighed heavily throughout the day. There was a strange comfort in the rhythm of my feet hitting the pavement, and by the end of each run, I could finally fall asleep without battling spiraling thoughts. Running became a space where I could simply exist.

## Why Running Endures

Running is often portrayed as a heroic battle against the self, but that’s a narrow way to look at it. You don’t need to be David Goggins, channeling some endless reservoir of inner turmoil, to find meaning in the movement. Running can be deeply personal, driven not by competition or performance but by the simple act of forward motion.

The beauty of running lies in its accessibility—it's a discipline that meets you where you are. Whether you aspire to complete your first 5K or simply clear your head, it’s not about how fast or far you go but about learning to trust your body. If you can begin to see yourself as a runner, you already are one.

Over the past two years, running has accompanied me through some of life’s most complicated moments. Each mile behind me has offered its lessons, and every step forward feels like an acknowledgment that there is more yet to discover.

## Key Lessons I've Learned

### 1. Nutrition and Hydration

Proper nutrition and hydration are cornerstones of sustainable running. Prepping meals is essential—not just for peak performance but for recovery. Make sure you’re getting enough protein to aid muscle repair, and don’t neglect easy carbs before long runs. A banana, simple as it is, can be the perfect fuel.

### 2. Soundtracks for Solitude

A good playlist or podcast can turn an ordinary run into a journey. Music sets the rhythm, and podcasts make long miles feel shorter. If you’re looking for inspiration, try Spotify’s Retro Running Playlist—just be prepared if someone asks, “Wait, you like The Smiths?”

### 3. Don’t Sweat the Tech

It’s easy to get lost in the allure of performance gear—running vests, GPS watches, and specialized shoes. But running is a minimalist activity at heart. You don’t need a $500 jacket or a high-end Garmin to get started. A solid pair of shoes and comfortable clothing will carry you further than you might think.

### 4. Find a Community

While solo runs offer introspection, the sense of belonging that comes from a running community is invaluable. Find a local run club, sign up for races, or connect with like-minded runners online. Running with others transforms a solitary pursuit into something collective, creating shared stories along the way.

## Injury Prevention Tips

Pushing limits is part of the process, but overreaching can come at a cost. I’ve learned, the hard way, that injuries don’t just disrupt your routine—they dismantle the mental clarity you work so hard to maintain.

- **Invest in good socks:** Invest in good socks. Blisters are no joke, and a high-quality pair, like Danish Endurance, is worth it.

- **Take recovery seriously:** Take at least one or two easy runs between intense sessions to prevent burnout.
- **Consult a physiotherapist:** A sports physiotherapist can provide invaluable guidance—not just for recovery but for smarter training.

## Strength Training: Beyond Running

Building muscular strength isn’t just about injury prevention; it also enhances endurance, posture, and overall well-being. Pull-ups, though unrelated to running mechanics, are excellent for maintaining upper-body strength.

- **Standard Pull-ups:** Develop your biceps and upper back—muscles that indirectly support running posture.
- **Wide Grip Pull-ups:** Engage your deltoid and lateral muscles, which are essential for functional strength in everyday life.

## Parting Thoughts

The beauty of running is in its simplicity. There’s no need to micromanage every detail—trust the process, embrace the journey, and find joy in the act of movement. It doesn’t matter whether your goal is to run a marathon or simply clear your head after a long day. Every step forward counts.

Each run pushed me to face my limits and view failure as an opportunity to build resilience. In high school, I often felt overwhelmed by challenges, but by the time I reached university, I approached obstacles differently. When balancing a heavy course load and part-time work felt daunting, I drew on the resilience running instilled in me. I adapted, sought support, learned from my experiences, and pursued discomfort, recognizing the value of learning from past setbacks to grow stronger.
Now, as the leader of the University of Toronto run club with hundreds of athletes, I learn from others' experiences while encouraging them to embrace discomfort and grow. Running has shown me that discomfort is a catalyst for growth, and I carry this belief into every obstacle I face.
